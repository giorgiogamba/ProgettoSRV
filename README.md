This is the project I developed for the university course "Virtual Reality Systems", a path focuing on the rendering basic knowledge.

For a part of the exam I developed this videogame, which a platformer where the character is a ball.

The aim of the game is to complete a series of challenges and then defeat the last boss.

Here are some screenshot of the game.
